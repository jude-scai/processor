### Always use built-in typing instead of imported typing.

For example, but not limited to:
- instead of using `List` from `typing`, use `list` directly
- instead of using `Dict` from `typing`, use `dict` directly
- instead of using `Tuple` from `typing`, use `tuple` directly
- instead of using `Set` from `typing`, use `set` directly

The list goes on.

### Always import all modules at the top of the file.

For example, but not limited to:
- instead of importing modules inside a function, import them at the top of the file.
